i think i have a really simple core game i am trying to build with it
as simple as something like this can be
that will let me quickly create new decks that tell their own stories/have their own secrets (except to wastes)
and we decided that obviously teh harvest will still accept prayers
but inverted now
before she accepted prayers all day besides during her breaks
but now she's remembered that 23 parts of herself come from a universe where all disputes are handled via childrens card game
so
she's playing zampanio the card game p much constantly 
then comes up for air twice a day for lunch and to panic remember she has prayers to answer
the prayers will then manifest as new card decks
created by me

there will be a lot of clowns inside them
but also i intend for the tools to be available to anyone brave enough to make their own decks to share
cuz the harvest is Change and Inspiration and Libraries and etc
i forgot all her domains
oh right, Being Served
she's a decadent self indulgent god who wants you to make things for her

okay actually no, that didn't work out, the kittens were too sick to visit AND someone else adopted them

but i found BETTER than them.

(sorry jimbo, i know your name was perfect but it wasn't meant to be)

i found an eyeless kitten named hallow, claimed to be born on halloween and his best friend who breathes really loud and scary but that lets him follow her around

they're so freaking adorable and loving and cute and hallow the eyesless void is so completely my aesthetic

faceless little kitty, its like the slugcatsona the herald made for me
